This repository is a collection of small HTML projects I've created. They were quick, simple experiments that I wanted to share. Each project leads to a different HTML page, including:

- **[Bomb](https://tempestaethel.github.io/Webs-of-Wonder/Completed/Bomb.html)**: An explosive test game
- **[RPS](https://tempestaethel.github.io/Webs-of-Wonder/Completed/RPS.html)**: Rock, Paper, Scissors
- **[Select](https://tempestaethel.github.io/Webs-of-Wonder/Completed/Choose.html)**: A Decision maker
- **[QR Generator](https://tempestaethel.github.io/Webs-of-Wonder/Completed/QR%20Generator.html)**: Generate QR codes
- **[QR Reader](https://tempestaethel.github.io/Webs-of-Wonder/Completed/QR%20Reader.html)**: Read QR codes
- **[Word of the Day](https://tempestaethel.github.io/Webs-of-Wonder/Completed/Word%20of%20the%20day.html)**: A random word generator
- **[HTML Executor](https://tempestaethel.github.io/Webs-of-Wonder/Completed/Html%20Executor.html)**: Execute HTML snippets
- **[API Checker](https://tempestaethel.github.io/Webs-of-Wonder/Completed/API%20Checker.html)**: Check APIs

Itâ€™s just a fun little project to explore and enjoy, which is constantly receiving updates with new HTML. All HTML files are present in the folder called "**[Completed](https://github.com/TempestAethel/Webs-of-Wonder/tree/main/Completed)**"
